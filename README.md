# This code is developed for the IEEE ICHI - 2019 Data Analytics Challenge on Missing data Imputation (DACMI).
# Details are provided at http://www.ieee-ichi.org/challenge.html

# The code for the Similarity-based Imputation of Missing Data in Electronic Health Records is written in R. 
# To run the code, you need two folders:
#  1. A folder containing the training data (reference files)
#  2. A folder containing the test data
# The code creates one single data frame composed of all the reference files.
# This data frame is used as a reference in the code for imputing missing values in test files.
